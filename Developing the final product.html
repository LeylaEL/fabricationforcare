    <h1>Heatme</h1>
     
     <li>HEATme is personalized heating device that recognizes the skin temperature and heats up automatically, when a certain temperature is reached. </li>
     <li>It works with a battery or powerbank</li>
     <li>And thus is portable and very convenient</li>
     
     <br>
     <p>In order to produce we worked off the following steps:</p>
     <li>Conduct research about existing tools, fabric, electronics</li>
     <li>Scan leg</li>
     <li>Repair in Meshmixer</li>
     <li>Transfer to fusion 360 and produce the front and back part as STL to transfer it to exactflat</li>
     <li>Flatten the parts in exactflat</li>
     <li>Cut them</li>
     <li>One piece of fabric was embroided with conducting yarn, which later on will heat up</li>
     <li>Electronics were programmed and installed</li>
     <li>Documentation was done continually</li>
     <li>A video to present our prototype was filmed in the end</li>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>HEATme can be personalized for many body parts such as, legs, arms, or around the belly and back. We chose to fit it to a leg for our prototype.
     <br>
     So the first step was to scan the leg.</p>
     <img src="IMG_6449kopie.jpg">
     <br>
     <p>The body needs to be scanned slowly and carefully to prevent holes and cracks. The file comes as an obj format and can then we worked with in Meshmixer</p>

     <img src="images/IMG_6593.jpg">
     <br>
     <p>After Meshmixer, the file is imported to Fusion 360, where a zylinder is pulled and adjusted over the leg. The body is cut horizontally into two parts and then saved individually as stl files. These two body parts can then we transferred to exactflat.</p>

     <br>
     <p>And here it is in exactflat and also ready to cut.</p>

     <img src="IMG_6736.jpg"> 
     <img src="IMG_6738.jpg"> 
     <br>
     <p>Since we will do two layers, here are the bottom and top layer of the back part.</p>
     <img src="IMG_6739.jpg"> 
     <br>
     <p>Here you can see that we forgot to delete the line in the middle so it was cut, too.</p>
       <img src="/IMG_6734.jpg"> 
     <br>
     <p>Now we needed to design the pattern for the embroidery which would be the conductive yarn that is supposed to heat up. We did that with illustrator.</p>
     <img src="images/IMG_6745.jpg"> 
     <br>
     <p>Then the fabric was prepared and embroidered.</p>

     <p>Understanding and programming the arduino took a lot of time. Here are some pictures of our work.</p>
