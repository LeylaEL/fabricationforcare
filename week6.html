<p>Week 6 consisted basically of the repetition of the laser cutter since most of the students did not finish their project before class.</p>
     
<br>
     <p>In the end and as a homework we were supposed to think of ideas for our final projects.</p>
     
     <br>
     <p>Here are my ideas:</p>
     
     
     <li>Innovative version of the Kleinert Gips</li>
        <li>Corsette for the lower belly, that warms up when women have their period and are in pain. Maybe it could even have a massage function</li>
     <p>We could make a scan of the lower belly area, and use textiles to create the corsette. Insert electronics that warm up and maybe massage.</p>
        <li>Walking stick that has an integrated navigation system or sos button, or storage for pills that need to be taken daily</li>
     <li>Glasses with integrated flash light, that recognize colors (for colorblind)</li>
     <li>Pulse measure - anxiety attacs -> calm music is played</li>
     <li>adjustable bra - after losing a breast due to cancer, that also has the weight of the left breast.</li>
     <li>Glasses able too zoom</li>
     <li>Wearable ultrsound to see baby on phone whenever you want</li>
     <li>Prosthetic with plectrum</li>
