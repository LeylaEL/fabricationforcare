        <p>We started with printing in 3D by first saving the joints in fusion 360 as STL. Each body is saved separately.</p> <br>

        <br>
            
        <p>Then we were able to open the two bodies with cura ulitmaker to prepare them for printing.</p>

        <br> <p>In the following the steps for preparing the print and printing can be seen.</p>

        <p>For this joint the printing process takes around 2 1/2 hours.</p>

         <h2 class="newlist">3D scanning</h2>
        
        <p>3D scanners are used for medical purposes, to catch drivers who drive too fast, to transform actors into different roles when filming, and so on. It can be used for many different purposes. To for example scan a hand, one must go around the hand slowly and without shaking and "close" every part of the hand.<br> In case of shaking and "breaking" the scan in some parts, meaning there are little holes in the scan, it can be fixed with the program called meshmixer.</p>
