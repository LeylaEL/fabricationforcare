<p>Usually, robots are made of hard material.
    But engineers were inspired by the octopus for example to build robots that are flexible and soft as the name says it. 
    <br>
    Soft robotics may be used to build wearable devices, but also for surgery.

    Air plays a role in soft robotis, too. It makes some object more squishy whereas when you take out the air, they are more stiff.
