        <p>accessathon videos, examples what is possible
     some notes:
            <oi>switch/brain/pedal... is input
     trigger/mirco controller is me
light/speaker/display is output     
     voltage keeps electrons moving
     preassure moves them
     I (amperes) = V (volts) / R (ohms) </oi>
     series circuit: each led 3 v(current) = battery 6v
            Parallel: battery is 3 = splitted current onto two leds
     </p>
     
     <br> 
     <p>arduino
     logic between 0 and 1 is digital
     (for example switch to turn on and off light)
     analog: music-> turn louder (range)</p>
     <p>Opne new, basic, blink, type in number of hole
     ground in blue(minus)
     (black kable usually for ground
     red usually V
     plug in as in picture
     calculate resistor .    R = (Vs- Vled)/Iled
     build in/integrate resistor</p>
